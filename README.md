# Statistical-Intelligence-for-Sports-Perfomance-Business-Strategy-Using-R
# Project Overview

This project applies statistical intelligence and exploratory analytics to historical IPL match data to extract insights that support sports performance evaluation and business strategy decision-making.

Unlike typical beginner projects, this work follows an industry-style analytics lifecycle, including project chartering, executive reporting, technical analysis, and strategic recommendations.
# Industry Focus

Domain: Sports Analytics
Sub-domain: Cricket (Indian Premier League – IPL)
Business Use Case:

Team performance evaluation

# Strategic decision support

Venue and toss-based analysis

Long-term business intelligence for sports franchises
Business Objectives

Identify consistent team performance patterns across seasons

Evaluate the strategic impact of toss decisions

Analyze venue-based advantages and biases

Convert statistical findings into business-level insights

Demonstrate end-to-end data science workflow using R

# Key Business Questions

Which teams demonstrate long-term dominance in the IPL?

Does winning the toss significantly affect match outcomes?

Are certain venues statistically favorable to specific teams?

How can franchises use historical data for strategic planning?

What insights can improve competitive decision-making?
